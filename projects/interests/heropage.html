        <p class = "pink"> My grandma blessed my whole life. She sacrificed her everthing for me. My family had
        goats, sheeps, chickens, cats, and dogs. <span class = "underline">My childhood fullfilled so much love 
        caused by our animal and my Grandma.</span>
         She taught me "loving others and animals". She spent time for me. We went to the Russia
          for victory parada.

        <h1 class="color2">My Hero &#129464; - Captain America </h1>
        <p class=" pink"> Captain America is my favorite movie from <strong> Marvel.</strong> There are some reasons why 
            this movie's main character is my hero. First of all, I learned most important 
            thing that if you're weak, it is not mean "you can't to do anything!" This character gives me
            <span class = "blue">motivation and inspiration.</span> It is the best character from action movies, but actor who
             played at Marvel's movie does't won any awards from Oscars &amp; Emmy Awards.&#127917;
