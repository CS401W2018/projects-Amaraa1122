        <h1>My Hero is My Grandma Adiya Jamsran &#128117; </h1>
        <p>My grandma blessed my whole life. She sacrificed her everthing for me. My family had
        goats, sheeps, chickens, cats, and dogs. My childhood fullfilled so much love 
        caused by our animal and my Grandma.
         She taught me "loving others and animals". She spent time for me. We went to the Russia
          for victory parada.

        <h1> My Hero &#129464; - Captain America </h1>
        <p> Captain America is my favorite movie from <strong> Marvel.</strong> There are some reasons why 
            this movie's main character is my hero. First of all, I learned most important 
            thing that if you're weak, it is not mean "you can't to do anything!" This character gives me
             motivation and inspiration. It is the best character from action movies, but actor who
             played at Marvel's movie does't won any awards from Oscars &amp; Emmy Awards.&#127917;
