    <p class = "pink"> I like to play Morin Khuur that horse head fiddle Mongolian instrument 
     but I have more intesest playing piano than horse head fiddle. I love it
      because I really love R&amp;B &amp; Pop songs. In the piano, people can play my
       favorite genre's songs very well. When I was child, my mom brought a computer 
    from her friends. That computer contained a lot of American pop song, especially pop songs
     that played with the piano &#127929;. Also, I saw missionaries playing piano.
    <span class= "blue">I just wanted to play it when I saw missionaries.</span> But I still can't play it.
     I listen to melody play by the piano always.  
    </p>
     
    <h2 class="color2"> Sports &#127939; </h2>
    <p class> I love two sports that golf and figure skating. I learned playing golf &#127948;for last summer break.
         I'm beginner golfer. <span class = "underline" > I always try to improve my golf skills.</span> Another sport is figure skating &#127935;. 
         The reason why I love this sport is I watched people's olympic
          performance from Russia when I was child. I wanted to learn it but in my country doesn't have
           figure skating course.
