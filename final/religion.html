            <h2>Story</h2>
            <p> I'm Christian. This religion changed my life so wonderfully.
                When I was 4years old, my family joined to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day-Saints. I saw the changes came to my life through
                religion. It was nice to see my mom and grandma smiled always. I felt true happiness. In this picture, I met American missionaries and I saw people
                 with blue eyes the first time. I thought, one of them was Jack from Titanic. They were the most kind people from who came to my home. I'm so greatful to them and my religion.
                 In the world, there are 4 big religions. They are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism.
                 I attached the table of religions and it might be interesting for you. What religion are you?
