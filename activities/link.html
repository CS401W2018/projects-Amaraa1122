        <h2> Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. 
            Why would you use relative links?</h2>
        <p><mark>An absolute link</marK> provides the complete location information of your site </p>
        <p> <mark>A relative link </mark> contains the location following your domain.</p>
        <P> The reason why I using a relative link is it is from inside sources that from my current Page
            and it will be easy to see and find. </p>
        
        <h2> Link to another engagement assignment (something in the activity folder).</h2>
        <p> Another engagement: <a href="structural.html"> Engagement for Friday </a> </p>
    
        <h2> List the 3 rules with relative links.</h2>
        <p> There are three rules: </p>
        <ol type="A">
           <li>Use same folder i.e. link.html</li> 
           <li>Different folder ../projects</li> 
           <li>Type up folder ..</li>
        </ol>
        <h2> Link to your last project. </h2>

        <h2> Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag? </h2>
        <p> links don't always need to be inside a nav tag. links can be placed <mark>outside of a 
            Nav tag </mark> they serve other purposes, like linking to external resources, references, 
            or even in content like articles or footers.</p>
