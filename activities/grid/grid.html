        <p class= "questions">What is the main difference between CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</p>
        <p> There are two main differences. <mark>Grid</mark> is only one demeinsional. 
            Also, it tells the where it's going and what size to be. Children of parent 
            size don't get to decide their own size. <mark>CSS Flex </mark>  is more of a 
        premissive parenting style. It doesn't tell what size they should be. </p>

        <div class = "parent">
