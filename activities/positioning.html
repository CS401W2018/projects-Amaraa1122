        <p>The Andean Volcanic Belt is a major volcanic belt along the Andean 
            cordillera in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. 
            It is formed as a result of subduction of the Nazca plate and Antarctic
             plate underneath the South American plate. The belt is subdivided into four
         main volcanic zones which are separated by volcanic gaps. The volcanoes of the belt
          are diverse in terms of activity style, products, and morphology. While some
           differences can be explained by which volcanic zone a volcano belongs to,
        there are significant differences within volcanic zones and even between
         neighboring volcanoes. </p>
