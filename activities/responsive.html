            <p> Why is the viewport meta tag important?</p>
            <p>  The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design because it controls 
                how a webpage is displayed on different devices, particularly
                 mobile screens.  </p>
            
            
            <p> How can you adjust the CSS for printing? </p>
            <p> Firstly, we should create a new page for printing and 
                then we should include new css to to HTML code with link tag. 
                Like " link rel = "stylesheet"  href = "print.css"  media="print">
            </p>
    
            <p>When would you want to adjust the CSS for printing?</p>
            <p> I'd want to adjust the CSS for printing in situations where you need 
                a well-formatted, printer-friendly version of a webpage.

            <p class = "enga"> Why do we need a viewport meta tag?</p>
            <p class="enga">The viewport meta tag is essential for making websites responsive and ensuring 
                they display correctly on different screen sizes, especially on mobile devices.  </p>
            <p class = "enga">When you select the same tag twice, and in one of them you say 
                "flex-direction: column;" and the other says "flex-direction: row;", which one takes priority? </p>
            <p class = "enga"> The rule that appears later in the CSS file takes priority, unless other factors
             such as specificity or important are involved. </p>

            <p class = "enga"> How do you change the CSS for a web page displayed on a phone? </p>
            <p class = "enga">I will use <strong>"@media (max-width: 600px)"</strong>  and I can chang pixels. Also, Media queries
                 allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size, resolution, 
                 or device type.   </p>
