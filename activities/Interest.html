    <h2> Music &#127901 &#127911 </h2>
    <p> I like to play horse head fiddle that Mongolian instrument but I have more intesest
         playing piano than horse head fiddle. I love it because I really love R&B and Pop songs. In
          the piano, people can play my favorite genre's songs very well. When I was child, my mom
           brought a computer from her relatives. That computer contained a lot of American pop song, especially pop songs that played with the piano &#127929.
        Also, I saw missionaries playing piano. I just wanted to play it when I saw missionaries. 
        But I still can't play it. I listen to melody play by the piano always.

     <h2> Sports &#127939</h2>
     <P> I love two sports that golf and ice skating. I learned playing golf&#127948for last summer break.
         I'm beginner golfer. I always try to improve my golf skills. Another sport is figure skating &#127935. The reason 
    why I love this sport is I watched people's olympic performance from Russia when I was child. 
    I wanted to learn it but in my country doesn't have figure skating course. </P>
